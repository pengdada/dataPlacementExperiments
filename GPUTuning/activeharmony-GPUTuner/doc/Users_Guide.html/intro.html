<div class="textblock"><p>Auto-tuning refers to the automated search for values to improve the performance of a target application. In this case, performance is an abstract term used to represent a measurable quantity. A common example of performance for auto-tuning is time, where the goal is to minimize execution time. Other possible examples include minimizing power usage or maximizing floating-point operations per second. In general, the Active Harmony framework seeks to minimize performance values and handles maximization via negation.</p>
<p>In order for auto-tuning to be effective, a set of parameters must exist that affect the target application's performance. A simple example is thread count for OpenMP applications, as changing the number of threads involved in executing a parallel program will certainly have an affect on run-time. Target application parameters are represented within Active Harmony as <b>tuning variables</b>.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_example"></a>
Motivating Example</h1>
<p>As a motivating example, consider the study conducted by Tiwari et al. on optimizing scientific codes. Applications written for scientific computing typically spend the bulk of their execution time in compute-heavy loops. These loops are prime candidates for a compiler optimization known as loop unrolling and tiling. Modifying the number of times a compiler unrolls or tiles a loop results in a distinct binary with different performance properties. However, the optimal number of times to unroll or tile any given loop is virtually impossible to know at compile time since it is dependent on target architecture. Compiling a priori with all possible unrolling and tiling values is prohibitively expensive, but using a sub-optimal binary also wastes valuable compute cycles.</p>
<p>Tiwari solved this problem by allowing an auto-tuner to search for optimal loop unrolling and tiling values. Using this approach, only a small fraction of the possible code variants are built, and an optimal (or near-optimal) version of the code is used for the majority of the execution.</p>
<p>We refer to this example throughout the rest of this manual.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_tunevar"></a>
Tuning Variables</h1>
<p>Tuning variables in Active Harmony require a distinct name, and must be declared as one of the following three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>INT</code> (Integer numbers)<br />
 This value range is constrained by a minimum (<code>m</code>), maximum (<code>M</code>), and a stepping value (<code>s</code>) where <code>m&lt;=M</code> and <code>s&gt;0</code>.</li>
<li><code>REAL</code> (Real numbers)<br />
 This value range is constrained by a minimum (<code>m</code>), maximum (<code>M</code>), and a stepping value (<code>s</code>) where <code>m&lt;=M</code> and <code>s&gt;0</code>.</li>
<li><code>ENUM</code> (Enumerated strings)<br />
 This value range is constrained by an explicit list of valid values.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_space"></a>
Search Spaces</h1>
<p>Each tuning variable may be seen as a <code>1</code>-dimensional range of values that are valid for a given application parameter. A collection of <code>N</code> tuning variables then creates an <code>N</code>-dimensional Euclidean space. We refer to this in Active Harmony as the <b>search space</b>. Points within the space represent a single possible configuration for the target application. For instance, if the following search space is defined:</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Variable Name </th><th>Bounds  </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>tile </td><td><code>m=1, M=4, s=1</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>unroll </td><td><code>m=2, M=16, s=2</code> </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>compiler </td><td><code>list={"GCC", "Intel", "PGI"}</code> </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The search will then be conducted within a <code>3</code>-dimensional space, and <code>(4, 12, "Intel")</code> would be a valid point within that space.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_feedback"></a>
The Feedback Loop</h1>
<p>Active Harmony works in tandem with a target application by manipulating tuning variables and observing the resulting performance. This creates a feedback loop where Active Harmony uses each incoming performance observation to further refine its search for optimal values. In Active Harmony, the tuning element is called the <b>tuning session</b> and the target application is called the <b>client</b>. They are connected in the following manner:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The tuning session <b>generates</b> a new point.</li>
<li>The client <b>fetches</b> the point, and operates for some period of time while measuring performance.</li>
<li>The client <b>reports</b> the performance value back to the tuning session.</li>
<li>The tuning session <b>analyzes</b> the report to guide its search for optimal points.</li>
<li>Repeat until the search converges.</li>
</ol>

 <h1><a class="anchor" id="intro_session"></a>
Tuning Session</h1>
<p>Conceptually, the tuning session is responsible for generating candidate points. Active Harmony divides this task into two key abstractions, the <b>search strategy</b> and the <b>processing layers</b>.</p>
<p>The search strategy determines how new candidate points are selected from the search space. For instance, one strategy might be to ignore all performance reports and simply return a random point. Several search strategies come bundled with Active Harmony, each with different properties to support a wide range of client applications. Note that search strategies operate purely at a numeric level by mapping search space points to reported performance values. They have no awareness of how the point will be used by the client.</p>
<p>The processing layers handle any additional tasks that must occur either before or after a point is generated. A prime example is the post processing to convert a numeric candidate point into client usable parameters. Consider the <a class="el" href="intro.html#intro_example">compiler loop unrolling and tiling example</a> described earlier. The client cannot directly use a numeric point such as <code>(3, 8, "Intel")</code> to execute a code variant. These values must first be sent to a compiler that will produce a binary to be executed by the client.</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="session.svg" alt="session.svg"/>
<div class="caption">
Detailed view of the Active Harmony tuning session.</div></div>
 The search strategy sits at the core of the tuning session, surrounded by concentric rings that represent processing layers. As points leave the search strategy, they must pass through the <b>generation</b> phase of each processing layer before it is made available to the client. Similarly, as performance reports are returned, they must pass through the <b>analyze</b> phase of each processing layer before it is received by the search strategy.</p>
<p>The processing layers are executed sequentially &mdash; in forward-order when leaving the search strategy, and backwards-order upon return. An individual processing layer may implement the generate action analyze action independent of one another, or both together to support paired functionality.</p>
<p>Finally, Active Harmony provides flexibility by implementing search strategies and processing layers as plug-ins that are loaded by the tuning session. This structure allows Active Harmony to meet the needs of any auto-tuning application with minimal effort. A specialized auto-tuner can effectively be built by parts.</p>
<p>Active Harmony is distributed with a set of search strategies and processing layers. Detailed information about these plug-ins can be found in the <a class="el" href="plugin.html">Plug-Ins</a> section. </p>
